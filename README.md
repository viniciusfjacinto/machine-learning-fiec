# Model Pipeline

This repository contains an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) for a profit prediction model pipeline. The pipeline includes tasks for data extraction, transformation, training, prediction, and evaluation of Industry orders.

You can find the original development script and additional comments about the model choosen and data exploration in [modelo.ipynb](https://github.com/viniciusfjacinto/machine-learning-fiec/blob/main/modelo.ipynb)

The Airflow DAG is in [ml_dag.py](https://github.com/viniciusfjacinto/machine-learning-fiec/blob/main/dags/ml_dag.py)

The file [dados.csv](https://github.com/viniciusfjacinto/machine-learning-fiec/blob/main/dados.csv) contains the data used in this project.

## Introduction

The purpose of this pipeline is to automate the process of analyzing, exploring, visualizing data, and creating a predictive model for the "Profit" column of the provided dataset. The pipeline leverages Airflow for orchestrating the workflow, allowing seamless execution and monitoring of each task.

## Tasks

### Extract Data
- **Process**:
  - Connects to an AWS Athena database using provided credentials.
  - Executes an SQL query to retrieve the dataset (`raw.fiec_industry_data`).
  - Returns the extracted data for further processing.

### Transform Data
- **Process**:
  - Preprocesses the extracted data:
    - Converts column names to title case.
    - Creates a binary categorical column "Profit_Class" based on whether Profit is greater than zero.
    - Encodes categorical variables such as "Customer_Name" and "Product_Name".
    - Performs feature engineering, including creating "Encoded_Customer" and "Encoded_Product" columns based on customer and product counts.
    - One-hot encodes remaining categorical columns.
    - Sets "Order_Id" as the index and drops irrelevant columns.
  - Returns the preprocessed data.

### Train Model
- **Process**:
  - Receives the preprocessed data from the previous task.
  - Divides the data into features (X) and target (y).
  - Identifies and removes highly correlated columns to avoid multicollinearity.
  - Splits the data into training and testing sets.
  - Selects the top 20 features using SelectKBest with f_regression scoring function.
  - Trains a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model with a linear kernel using the selected features.
  - Returns the filtered training features, testing features, and target variables.

### Predict
- **Process**:
  - Receives the filtered training and testing features along with target variables.
  - Utilizes the trained SVR model to predict the target variable on the testing dataset.
  - Calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted and actual values.
  - Returns the predicted values and actual values in DataFrame format.

### Evaluate Model
- **Process**:
  - Receives the predicted and actual values from the previous task.
  - Calculates the percentage difference between the predicted and actual values.
  - Counts the number of predictions with less than 20% difference from the actual values.
  - Calculates the percentage of satisfactory predictions.
  - Returns the percentage of satisfactory predictions.
